# Digital Humanities Research Centers Map: Guide 
Hi evreyone, 

We are a group of students who developed a project to create a map of research centers in Digital Humanities. Our goal was to make the map collaborative, open, and easy to navigate. We built it using **QGIS** software and exported it as a **TIFF file**, which can be found in the repository materials.

 
 To enable collaboration, we created this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map), where you can find all the necessary materials to contribute to the project. We have also provided informational text to guide you through the process of adding new research centers to the map. 
 

## Criteria for Adding a Center

To be included, a research center must:

<ul>
  
  <li> Be <b> operational</b> </li>

  <li> Focus primarily on <b>Digital Humanities research</b> </li>

  <li> Have <b>dedicated physical spaces</b> that can be accurately mapped </li>

</ul>

## Repository Contents

in the repository, you will find:

 > a [CSV](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/DH%20Centers%20coordinates.csv) file containing data ontaining data on all research centers </li>

 > a [QGZ](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/DH%20Centers%20Map.qgz) with the editable map </li>
    
 >  a simple [Guide](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/How%20to%20add%20a%20center%20in%20the%20Map%20(Guide).pdf) to help you add new centers </li>
  
 >  a [TIFF](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/Digital%20Humanities%20Research%20Centers%20Across%20the%20Globe.tiff) with a finalized version of the map

 > a [HTML](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/Interactive%20Map/index.html) file (along with four required foulders) for an interactive version of the map



We also included other kinds of maps showing the same data but displayed in different ways. 

We hope youâ€™ll join us in building the most accurate and visually engaging map on this topic. Your contributions will help make this resource as comprehensive and useful as possible!
