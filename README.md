###  Digital Humanities Research Centers Map: Guide 
Hi evreyone, we are a group of students who created a project to create a map of research centers in Digital Humanities. This map needed to be collaborative, open, and easy to navigate. The map was created using **QGIS** software and was exported in a TIFF file format, foundable on the materials of the repository.

To make the map collaborative we created this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map), where you can find materials to collaborate on the project. We have also made available informational text that can guide you through the process of adding a new center to the map. 


Please note that the center or centers you want to add must be:

<ul>
  
  <li> operational;</li>

  <li> research mainly in Digital Humanities;</li>

  <li> have dedicated spaces to be able to track them on the map. </li>

</ul>


In the repository, we included: 

 > a [CSV](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/DH%20Centers.csv) file containing all the data regarding the centers;</li>

 > a [QGZ](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/DH%20Centers%20Map.qgz) file containing the editable map;</li>
    
 >  a simple [guide], as mentioned before; </li>
  
 >  a [TIFF](https://github.com/DHMap/DH-Research-Centers-Map/blob/main/DH%20centers%20mao.tiff) file containing a "final" version of the map.</li> 



We also included other kinds of maps showing the same data but displayed in different ways. 

We hope you can help us build the most accurate and graphically pleasing map available on this topic.
